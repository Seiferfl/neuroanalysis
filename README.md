# Flo's Repo for the course on Neuro-Analysis at Radboud University.
In this repo, you can view the code that I wrote for the course on Neuro-Analysis. There are three separate folders, one for each topic that we dealt with in the course.

The solutions to the exercises of assignment 1 can be found in
